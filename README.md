## About:
This counter is a project for the Javascript Basics course at start2impact University. It WAS designed to be responsive and minimal, doing what it needs to do, plain and simple. BUT NOT ANYMORE.
<ol> 
<li>The index.html file contained whatever needed to be plain and simple as mentioned, but now it contains even more;</li>
<li>The style.css file was simple and basically organized: it cointained whatever was needed to make the plainitude e simplitude plain and simple, but now is time to insert the "NOT SO" before the concept of PLAIN and SIMPLE.</li>
<li>The script.js file contains the main code. Since, if I'm not mistaken, it hasn't been mentioned yet, it allowed the main code to function plain and simple. NOW IT GOES EVEN FURTHER.</li>
<li>The Color Palette chosen is taken from a Videogame sprite work that i'm doin in the free time</li>
</ol>
